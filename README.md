# Search Engine Optimization Refactoring


## Description

This application is to demonstrate following accesibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. This was done by using semantic HTML and improving CSS through refactoring an existing code. The goal of refactoring is to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior. 


Changes that were made included refactoring codes so that they follow semantic HTML, making changes to the CSS file so that it follows a logial structure, including alt attributs to image elements, making sure that heading elements are in sequential order, and that the site has a clear and descriptive title.
